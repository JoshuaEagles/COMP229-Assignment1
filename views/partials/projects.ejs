		<h3>Tetris Clone</h3>
		<p>A tetris clone written in Python with the Pygame framework. Includes all the basic features of Tetris, such as line clears, piece rotation, and a preview of the next piece.
		It was created to further my understanding of Python as well as to learn the Pygame framework.</p>

		<h3>Tower Defense Game</h3>
		<p>A small Tower Defense game made in Godot and programmed in C#. It was worked on by me and a couple others, and was developed as an entry for Global Game Jam 2020, 
		where you have 48 hours to make a game. While we ended up running out of time, working on this project was still a great learning experience, especially considering 
		the tight deadline.</p>
